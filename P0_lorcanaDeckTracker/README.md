Lorcana is a new Disney based Trading Card Game (TCG) that I recently got into. It features many cool Disnay characters from Disney movies and it's still realeasing many cards.

    <h3>Project Statement</h3>
</div>
I am making a console app using .net applications that will track the deck you are currently building! This deck tracker will help you easily manage your decks by letting you create, edit, save and add decks to your overall desck list.(Disclamer, due to the amount of cards available, there will only be a certain amount of cards that will be implimented to keep this project simple.)
